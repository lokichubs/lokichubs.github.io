Hey, I'm Lokesh Sriram (AKA Loki), an engineering student with a passion for transforming complex technical challenges, and cool ideas, into innovative solutions. Born with an insatiable curiosity, I find joy in bridging the worlds of robotics, machine learning, and creative problem-solving.

The ability of engineering to turn ideas into reality fascinates me. Through hands-on research experiences at Ray W Herrick Laboratories and TRACE Lab, I've learned to navigate the entire innovation cycle, transforming conceptual challenges into practical, impactful solutions

When I'm not diving into technical projects, you'll find me exploring my diverse interests.I box when university gets particularly frustrating. I make music when I need a break (check out my soundcloud) . I sing and play the piano before each an every exam.Finally,if I can find the time , I read manga and watch anime

My journey is driven by a simple goal: to create technology that makes a meaningful difference in how we live, work, and interact with the world around us and having fun while doing so.
