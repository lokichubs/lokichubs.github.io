title: Power Over Ethernet (POE) Lighting System Implementation
description: Designed and deployed a Direct Current (DC) lighting system. Determined new system uses 20% less energy on larger scales compared to AC Lighting systems using custom built current data aquicition system based on R-Pi. (Led to my first lead author publication - lets goooo)

The project revolved around implementing a DC Lighting system with devices from <a href='https://www.poetexas.com'>PoE Texas</a> in a residential space with Direct Current (DC) distribution panel. First the key components needed to be installed in the system.

Once this was obtained, each device needed to be uniquely labeled and installed in the first floor. The unique ID process allowed for automation of the entire control system.

The next step involved testing the lighting system installation on different scales and relevant debugging prior to data collection.

To compare the DC and the AC lighting system, a data acquisition system for the current was made and installed on the DC distribution panel. The system utlized and arudino,ACS 712 (a hobby current sensor), ADS1115 (analog to digital converter), and C++ code (will upload to github soon) to measure the current. Since the DC panel held a constant voltage, the power was then calculated using P=VI.

The first hand comparison of their power consumption showed that DC consumed more power than AC lighting systems for 1 room scale

However, scaling the power consumption to any room larger than one shows that DC lights are favorable

The images show that the DC Lighting PoE system is less efficient at a smaller scale. However, on a larger scale, the power savings can go up to 22%.
