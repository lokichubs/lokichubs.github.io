I like making tracks in FL Studio in my free time. So far I've made multiple tracks but not all of them are mixed - expect this list to get larger and update more frequently 

The finalized beats can be found on my <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/loki_chubs">Soundcloud</a> as well

An EP called "THE JUICEBOX" has the 6 tracks below - each song is supposed to be taste like a certain juice - don't ask why lol - has to do with "THE DRINK". If you know you know.

The tracks below are scrap tracks that probably will end up on a different project (they do not sound like any juice)
