This project revolved around several sub-projects. To familiarize myself with the design practices for aerodynamic automotive engineering, I designed my own aerofoil in Siemens NX.

My work mainly revolved around the manufacturing of multiple automotive parts from start to finish. The first step usually would be designing the mould for the part in Seimens NX.

Prior to manufacturing the part, Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) was done on each part in Fusion 360.

    </div>

Finally the part would be manufactured using a HAAS Gantry Sheet. Once the mold is manufacutred, resin vaccum enclosure would be used to set the carbon fiber layers -  to get heavy and durable parts of the car frame

    </div>

In addition to this, I often worked on assembling different parts of the car frame - working on creating and machining jigging elements using water jet machines

In the year of 2023, the Purdue FSAE team placed 2nd overall in the National Michigan races!!
